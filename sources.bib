The ARC’s focus on broad generalization and few-shot learning has made it difficult to solve using pure machine learning. A more promising approach has been to perform program synthesis within an appropriately designed Domain Specific Language (DSL). However, these too have seen limited success. We propose Abstract Reasoning with Graph Abstractions (ARGA), a new object-centric framework that first represents images using graphs and then performs a search for a correct program in a DSL that is based on the abstracted graph space. The complexity of this combinatorial search is tamed through the use of constraint acquisition, state hashing, and Tabu search. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates the promise of ARGA in tackling some of the complicated object-centric tasks of the ARC rather efficiently, producing programs that are correct and easy to understand.}, number={4}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Xu, Yudong and Khalil, Elias B. and Sanner, Scott}, year={2023}, month={Jun.}, pages={4115-4122} }

In this work, we introduce an ARC solver, Generalized Planning for Abstract Reasoning (GPAR). It casts an ARC problem as a generalized planning (GP) problem, where a solution is formalized as a planning program with pointers. We express each ARC problem using the standard Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) coupled with external functions representing object-centric abstractions. We show how to scale up GP solvers via domain knowledge specific to ARC in the form of restrictions over the actions model, predicates, arguments and valid structure of planning programs. Our experiments demonstrate that GPAR outperforms the state-of-the-art solvers on the object-centric tasks of the ARC, showing the effectiveness of GP and the expressiveness of PDDL to model ARC problems. The challenges provided by the ARC benchmark motivate research to advance existing GP solvers and understand new relations with other planning computational models.

abstract = {We describe a computational model for solving problems from Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM), a family of standardized intelligence tests. Existing computational models for solving RPM problems generally reason over amodal propositional representations of test inputs. However, there is considerable evidence that humans can also apply imagery-based reasoning strategies to RPM problems, in which processes rooted in perception operate over modal representations of test inputs. In this paper, we present the “affine model,” a computational model that simulates modal reasoning by using iconic visual representations together with affine and set transformations over these representations to solve a given RPM problem. Various configurations of the affine model successfully solve between 33 and 38 of the 60 problems on the Standard Progressive Matrices, which matches levels of performance for typically developing 9- to 11-year-old children. This suggests that, for at least a sizeable subset of RPM problems, it is not always necessary to extract amodal symbols in order to arrive at the correct answer, and iconic visual representations constitute a sufficient form of representation to successfully solve these problems. We intend for the affine model to serve as a complementary computational account to existing propositional models, which together may provide an integrated, dual-process account of human problem solving on the RPM.}
